          <h2 class="story-title">The Legend of Roaring Pepe 🐸</h2>
          <div class="story-content">
            <p class="story-paragraph">
              In the depths of the memetic jungle, where memes are born and legends are forged, 
              there lived a peculiar frog unlike any other. His name was Roaring Pepe, and his 
              roar could shake the very foundations of the internet.
            </p>
            <p class="story-paragraph">
              Unlike his cousins who spent their days feeling sad or smug, Roaring Pepe had discovered 
              something far more powerful: the ability to unite communities through pure, unbridled chaos. 
              With each roar, he brought together builders, dreamers, and shitposters alike, creating a 
              movement that would echo across the blockchain.
            </p>
            <p class="story-paragraph">
              They say that on quiet nights, when the gas fees are low and the moon is full, you can 
              still hear his mighty roar across the metaverse, calling all who dare to embrace the chaos 
              and build something legendary together. And so, the Chaos Board was born — a place where 
              the community's wildest ideas come to life, one roar at a time.
